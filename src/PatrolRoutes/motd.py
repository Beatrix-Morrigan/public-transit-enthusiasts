		| IMPORTANT: Please read these safety suggestions before you start. |
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
		- Fares & anonymity:
			- Riding this entire loop will cost you $2.50 if you use a PRONTO card.
			- PRONTO cards purchased with bank cards or created in the app are linked to your identity.
			- PRONTO cards can be purchased and reloaded with cash at all Trolley stations.	

		- MTS surveillance
			- Buses and Trolley cars have full internal and 360 degree external camera coverage.
			- All transit centers and Trolley stations have security cameras.
			- A bus driving towards you or away from you is recording you. Mask before you
			  arrive at a bus stop or Trolley station.
			
		- MTS security
			- Though not sworn officers, ALL security officers can make arrests. Treat them as cops.
			- Yellow shirt: MTS employee, unarmed, issues citations for fare evasion, etc.
			- Blue shirt: Contract security (currently Inter-Con), ~50% of them are armed.
			- MTS is predictably responding to austerity with heavy-handed fare enforcement. Skipping
			  fare payment at Trolley stations is not recommended.
			
		- Miscellaneous
			- A bus or Trolley line in these instructions is always listed
			  as "<route name or number> to/towards <terminal destination>."
			- The terminal destinations listed here should always match the vehicle's headsign display
			  and the bus stop or Trolley platform sign.
			- Bus headsigns can have errors. If the stop you're at matches the destination in the instructions
			  but the bus headsign is different, confirm the direction with the operator.
			- At any given time, there are always routes with detours or closed bus stops, check 
			  https://www.sdmts.com/getting-around/alerts-detours before starting.
